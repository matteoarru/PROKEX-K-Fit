A product deviating from the specification in one parameter may be dispensed in case the delivering organisation has obtained a written deviation permit from the customer.

The off-spec product – or the transport means holding it - must be treated in a way that an incidental delivery or mixing into an on-spec product is prevented.

The cause of all observed non-conformities must be investigated in a documented manner, and on that basis the suitable measures must be taken for handling it and for preventing its re-occurrence. 

When handling a non conforming product the correction of the product quality (up- or downgrading) must be considered as primary goal in all cases in order to minimise the loss generated. The conformity of the corrected product must be verified with a certificate.

Accounting for transport losses:

For loaded quantities within MOL Group (supplying own terminals) no transport difference may be accounted for. (Except the transport means arrived with damaged or incomplete security seals. In that case the realized loss must be claimed from the transporter)

In other cases transport loss may be accounted for transportation with suspended excise tax or approved customer claims only, case by case on the basis of difference between the quantity of the dispatched and received goods. For an EU delivery a counter signature by the authorities is required and the duty will be levied through a resolution by the member state authority.

The shortage generated in transit is the liability of the dispatching tax warehouse, except if an agreement has been made with the transporter on the joint and several liabilities. 

For release to free circulation the losses must be accounted for document by document (SAAD - Simplified Accompanying Administration Document). The quantity leaving the tax warehouse must be shown compulsorily on the SAAD. The accounting for loss in transit must be regulated in a contract.

When defining the acceptable loss norms the norms set forth in the applicable regulations of the given country, are applicable. In case the norms of the applicable national regulation are more permissive than those defined in appendix 4, the values in the present table must be used.


All shortages above the norm, generated in the transportation process, must be investigated and reported to the head of Product Storage Management and to the head of the relevant Transportation Unit (Road, Rail/Barge).

In case the loss in transit has occurred due to theft (e.g. broken lead seal is found), the total quantity of the shortage must be included in the product balance as a theft, with an authority report prepared.

For loaded quantities within MOL Group (supplying own terminals) no transport difference may be accounted for. (Except the transport means arrived with damaged or incomplete security seals. In that case the realized loss must be claimed from the transporter)

In other cases transport loss may be accounted for transportation with suspended excise tax or approved customer claims only, case by case on the basis of difference between the quantity of the dispatched and received goods. For an EU delivery a counter signature by the authorities is required and the duty will be levied through a resolution by the member state authority.

The shortage generated in transit is the liability of the dispatching tax warehouse, except if an agreement has been made with the transporter on the joint and several liabilities. 

For release to free circulation the losses must be accounted for document by document (SAAD - Simplified Accompanying Administration Document). The quantity leaving the tax warehouse must be shown compulsorily on the SAAD. The accounting for loss in transit must be regulated in a contract.

"Transferring the risk of product, registering the discharge- Road",incomplete security seal,99.5,"
Accounting for transport losses:

For loaded quantities within MOL Group (supplying own terminals) no transport difference may be accounted for. (Except the transport means arrived with damaged or incomplete security seals. In that case the realized loss must be claimed from the transporter)

In other cases transport loss may be accounted for transportation with suspended excise tax or approved customer claims only, case by case on the basis of difference between the quantity of the dispatched and received goods. For an EU delivery a counter signature by the authorities is required and the duty will be levied through a resolution by the member state authority.

The shortage generated in transit is the liability of the dispatching tax warehouse, except if an agreement has been made with the transporter on the joint and several liabilities. 

For release to free circulation the losses must be accounted for document by document (SAAD - Simplified Accompanying Administration Document). The quantity leaving the tax warehouse must be shown compulsorily on the SAAD. The accounting for loss in transit must be regulated in a contract. 

The product transfer pipeline functions as a special tax warehouse, the loss that can be accounted during delivery by product transport pipeline, is set forth by the customs and finance guard agency exercising the current authority supervision of the tax warehouse, with consideration given to the characteristics relating to the product transfer pipeline.

For the acceptable loss for non-excise duty licensed trading (retail) of the excise duty mineral oil products the country-specific loss regulation is applicable.

The rates of acceptable loss norms during deliveries are covered in Appendix 4. When defining the acceptable loss norms the norms set forth in the applicable regulations of the given country, are applicable.

Appropriate seals must be placed on the caverns of the barge. The numbers of the placed seals must be noted on the shipping documents.


Accounting for transport losses:

For loaded quantities within MOL Group (supplying own terminals) no transport difference may be accounted for. (Except the transport means arrived with damaged or incomplete security seals. In that case the realized loss must be claimed from the transporter)

In other cases transport loss may be accounted for transportation with suspended excise tax or approved customer claims only, case by case on the basis of difference between the quantity of the dispatched and received goods. For an EU delivery a counter signature by the authorities is required and the duty will be levied through a resolution by the member state authority.

In other cases transport loss may be accounted for transportation with suspended excise tax or approved customer claims only, case by case on the basis of difference between the quantity of the dispatched and received goods. For an EU delivery a counter signature by the authorities is required and the duty will be levied through a resolution by the member state authority.

The shortage generated in transit is the liability of the dispatching tax warehouse, except if an agreement has been made with the transporter on the joint and several liabilities. 

For release to free circulation the losses must be accounted for document by document (SAAD - Simplified Accompanying Administration Document). The quantity leaving the tax warehouse must be shown compulsorily on the SAAD. The accounting for loss in transit must be regulated in a contract.

For the acceptable loss for non-excise duty licensed trading (retail) of the excise duty mineral oil products the country-specific loss regulation is applicable.

The rates of acceptable loss norms during deliveries are covered in Appendix 4. When defining the acceptable loss norms the norms set forth in the applicable regulations of the given country, are applicable. In case the norms of the applicable national regulation are more permissive than those defined in appendix 4, the values in the present table must be used.


All shortages above the norm, generated in the transportation process, must be investigated and reported to the head of Product Storage Management and to the head of the relevant Transportation Unit (Road, Rail/Barge).

In case the loss in transit has occurred due to theft (e.g. broken lead seal is found), the total quantity of the shortage must be included in the product balance as a theft, with an authority report prepared.

Controlling the quantity - Barge,local excise duty regulation,104.0,"a. General rules for quantitative acceptance of a product

Defining the quantity received may be made on the basis of the pre- and post-gauging data of the tank, or by other verified metering device (such as a flow meter).
If it is made on the basis of tank gauging data, the procedure to follow is:

The product quantity in the receiving tank must be measured before the reception (so called pre-gauging) and after the reception (so called post-gauging). The gauging procedure must be carried out during every reception. 

The quantity of the received product is the difference between the pre and post gauging results.
After the reception, it must be defined whether a shortage or surplus is found. In case shortage or surplus is found the responsible manager must initiate the proper corrective action, or claim as necessary.
A shortage/surplus report must be prepared in accordance with the local excise duty regulations.

Based on the gauging results a report on the product reception must be prepared and continuously kept in a “Tank Log”, or in any other document or IT application that satisfies the minimum contents requirements set in Appendix 15. 

If accounting is not made on tank data basis, but on the data from other measuring device, the pre and post gauging data of the goods receiving tank still must be taken into consideration.

During the reception procedure, the use of a running gauge system (receiving and loading at the same time in/from storage tank) should be avoided if possible (taking into considerations technical features).
d. Special requirements for quantitative handover/takeover procedure by barge

In case of difference between the quantity of the received product and the quantity given by the control measurement (e.g. barge cubing) is not in excess of the control measurement accuracy 0.3% (or of the rate set forth in the commercial contract), the quantitative accounting and acceptance of the product received by barge must be performed on the basis of sender’s transport documents.
If the difference is greater than 0.3% the acceptance or accounting must be made on the basis of the control measurement (e.g. barge cubing).

A report (so called protocol) must be prepared on the product acceptance and is to be signed off by both the transferring and the receiving party.

In case of difference between the quantity of the received product and the quantity given by the control measurement (e.g. barge cubing) is not in excess of the control measurement accuracy 0.3% (or of the rate set forth in the commercial contract), the quantitative accounting and acceptance of the product received by barge must be performed on the basis of sender’s transport documents.
If the difference is greater than 0.3% the acceptance or accounting must be made on the basis of the control measurement (e.g. barge cubing).

A report (so called protocol) must be prepared on the product acceptance and is to be signed off by both the transferring and the receiving party.

Controlling the quantity - Barge,control measurement barge,17.333333333333336,"a. General rules for quantitative acceptance of a product

Defining the quantity received may be made on the basis of the pre- and post-gauging data of the tank, or by other verified metering device (such as a flow meter).
If it is made on the basis of tank gauging data, the procedure to follow is:

The product quantity in the receiving tank must be measured before the reception (so called pre-gauging) and after the reception (so called post-gauging). The gauging procedure must be carried out during every reception. 

The quantity of the received product is the difference between the pre and post gauging results.
After the reception, it must be defined whether a shortage or surplus is found. In case shortage or surplus is found the responsible manager must initiate the proper corrective action, or claim as necessary.
A shortage/surplus report must be prepared in accordance with the local excise duty regulations.

Based on the gauging results a report on the product reception must be prepared and continuously kept in a “Tank Log”, or in any other document or IT application that satisfies the minimum contents requirements set in Appendix 15. 

If accounting is not made on tank data basis, but on the data from other measuring device, the pre and post gauging data of the goods receiving tank still must be taken into consideration.

If it is made on the basis of tank gauging data, the procedure to follow is:

The product quantity in the receiving tank must be measured before the reception (so called pre-gauging) and after the reception (so called post-gauging). The gauging procedure must be carried out during every reception. 

The quantity of the received product is the difference between the pre and post gauging results.
After the reception, it must be defined whether a shortage or surplus is found. In case shortage or surplus is found the responsible manager must initiate the proper corrective action, or claim as necessary.
A shortage/surplus report must be prepared in accordance with the local excise duty regulations.

Based on the gauging results a report on the product reception must be prepared and continuously kept in a “Tank Log”, or in any other document or IT application that satisfies the minimum contents requirements set in Appendix 15. 

If accounting is not made on tank data basis, but on the data from other measuring device, the pre and post gauging data of the goods receiving tank still must be taken into consideration.

If it is made on the basis of tank gauging data, the procedure to follow is:

The product quantity in the receiving tank must be measured before the reception (so called pre-gauging) and after the reception (so called post-gauging). The gauging procedure must be carried out during every reception. 

The quantity of the received product is the difference between the pre and post gauging results.
After the reception, it must be defined whether a shortage or surplus is found. In case shortage or surplus is found the responsible manager must initiate the proper corrective action, or claim as necessary.
A shortage/surplus report must be prepared in accordance with the local excise duty regulations.

Based on the gauging results a report on the product reception must be prepared and continuously kept in a “Tank Log”, or in any other document or IT application that satisfies the minimum contents requirements set in Appendix 15. 

If accounting is not made on tank data basis, but on the data from other measuring device, the pre and post gauging data of the goods receiving tank still must be taken into consideration.

During the reception procedure, the use of a running gauge system (receiving and loading at the same time in/from storage tank) should be avoided if possible (taking into considerations technical features).
e. Special requirements for quantitative handover/takeover procedure by road tanker

The quantitative handover/takeover of oil products arriving by road tank trucks must be performed on the basis of certified flow meters, certified electronic dip-stick or based on gross and tare weighing carried out on certified road bridge scales. 
Subject to the delivery terms (parity) the quantitative entry of the product into the inventory must be made – in the absence of road weighing bridge or flow meter – on the basis of tank gauging and the density data of a sample taken from the shipment

c. Special requirements for quantitative handover/takeover procedure by rail

In case of a delivery between a supplier within MOL Group and MOL Group’s tax warehouses and terminals with excise duty licence, the basis of the acceptance is the net quantity shown on the bill of lading for an undamaged shipment and loss in transport cannot be charged unless there are special restrictions in the local law.  
For a qualified supplier, in case the shipment is undamaged, the net quantity shown on the bill of lading must be entered into the inventory, unless otherwise is provided in the contract or local legislation.

For any other supply, if upon weighting prior to unloading, a difference in excess of 0,2% - for gases the allowable maximum difference is 200kg – is found compared to the bill of lading, and in all cases when receiving Bio-ethanol and FAME, the basis for the reception is the quantity established by official weighting carried out on receiver’s site unless otherwise provided for in the contract or in the local legislation.

For rail tank cars (RTC) with broken or missing lead seals the arriving goods must be registered in the inventory on the basis of the  bridge scales slips prepared upon the weighting made wagon by wagon on receiver’s certified/verified bridge scales. The cause of possible differences must be investigated in a joint effort with the supplier and a report must be prepared on the investigation.

In case of a delivery between a supplier within MOL Group and MOL Group’s tax warehouses and terminals with excise duty licence, the basis of the acceptance is the net quantity shown on the bill of lading for an undamaged shipment and loss in transport cannot be charged unless there are special restrictions in the local law.  
For a qualified supplier, in case the shipment is undamaged, the net quantity shown on the bill of lading must be entered into the inventory, unless otherwise is provided in the contract or local legislation.

For any other supply, if upon weighting prior to unloading, a difference in excess of 0,2% - for gases the allowable maximum difference is 200kg – is found compared to the bill of lading, and in all cases when receiving Bio-ethanol and FAME, the basis for the reception is the quantity established by official weighting carried out on receiver’s site unless otherwise provided for in the contract or in the local legislation.

For rail tank cars (RTC) with broken or missing lead seals the arriving goods must be registered in the inventory on the basis of the  bridge scales slips prepared upon the weighting made wagon by wagon on receiver’s certified/verified bridge scales. The cause of possible differences must be investigated in a joint effort with the supplier and a report must be prepared on the investigation.

Controlling the quantity - RTC,post-gauging data,100.16666666666666,"a. General rules for quantitative acceptance of a product

Defining the quantity received may be made on the basis of the pre- and post-gauging data of the tank, or by other verified metering device (such as a flow meter).
If it is made on the basis of tank gauging data, the procedure to follow is:

The product quantity in the receiving tank must be measured before the reception (so called pre-gauging) and after the reception (so called post-gauging). The gauging procedure must be carried out during every reception. 

The quantity of the received product is the difference between the pre and post gauging results.
After the reception, it must be defined whether a shortage or surplus is found. In case shortage or surplus is found the responsible manager must initiate the proper corrective action, or claim as necessary.
A shortage/surplus report must be prepared in accordance with the local excise duty regulations.

Based on the gauging results a report on the product reception must be prepared and continuously kept in a “Tank Log”, or in any other document or IT application that satisfies the minimum contents requirements set in Appendix 15. 

If accounting is not made on tank data basis, but on the data from other measuring device, the pre and post gauging data of the goods receiving tank still must be taken into consideration.

During the reception procedure, the use of a running gauge system (receiving and loading at the same time in/from storage tank) should be avoided if possible (taking into considerations technical features).

For any other supply, if upon weighting prior to unloading, a difference in excess of 0,2% - for gases the allowable maximum difference is 200kg – is found compared to the bill of lading, and in all cases when receiving Bio-ethanol and FAME, the basis for the reception is the quantity established by official weighting carried out on receiver’s site unless otherwise provided for in the contract or in the local legislation.

For rail tank cars (RTC) with broken or missing lead seals the arriving goods must be registered in the inventory on the basis of the  bridge scales slips prepared upon the weighting made wagon by wagon on receiver’s certified/verified bridge scales. The cause of possible differences must be investigated in a joint effort with the supplier and a report must be prepared on the investigation.

Controlling the quantity - RTC,reception procedure,76.83333333333334,"a. General rules for quantitative acceptance of a product

Defining the quantity received may be made on the basis of the pre- and post-gauging data of the tank, or by other verified metering device (such as a flow meter).
If it is made on the basis of tank gauging data, the procedure to follow is:

The product quantity in the receiving tank must be measured before the reception (so called pre-gauging) and after the reception (so called post-gauging). The gauging procedure must be carried out during every reception. 

The quantity of the received product is the difference between the pre and post gauging results.
After the reception, it must be defined whether a shortage or surplus is found. In case shortage or surplus is found the responsible manager must initiate the proper corrective action, or claim as necessary.
A shortage/surplus report must be prepared in accordance with the local excise duty regulations.

Based on the gauging results a report on the product reception must be prepared and continuously kept in a “Tank Log”, or in any other document or IT application that satisfies the minimum contents requirements set in Appendix 15. 

If accounting is not made on tank data basis, but on the data from other measuring device, the pre and post gauging data of the goods receiving tank still must be taken into consideration.

During the reception procedure, the use of a running gauge system (receiving and loading at the same time in/from storage tank) should be avoided if possible (taking into considerations technical features).

Controlling the quantity - RTC,local law,41.0,"a. General rules for quantitative acceptance of a product

Defining the quantity received may be made on the basis of the pre- and post-gauging data of the tank, or by other verified metering device (such as a flow meter).
If it is made on the basis of tank gauging data, the procedure to follow is:

The product quantity in the receiving tank must be measured before the reception (so called pre-gauging) and after the reception (so called post-gauging). The gauging procedure must be carried out during every reception. 

The quantity of the received product is the difference between the pre and post gauging results.
After the reception, it must be defined whether a shortage or surplus is found. In case shortage or surplus is found the responsible manager must initiate the proper corrective action, or claim as necessary.
A shortage/surplus report must be prepared in accordance with the local excise duty regulations.

Based on the gauging results a report on the product reception must be prepared and continuously kept in a “Tank Log”, or in any other document or IT application that satisfies the minimum contents requirements set in Appendix 15. 

If accounting is not made on tank data basis, but on the data from other measuring device, the pre and post gauging data of the goods receiving tank still must be taken into consideration.

During the reception procedure, the use of a running gauge system (receiving and loading at the same time in/from storage tank) should be avoided if possible (taking into considerations technical features).
c. Special requirements for quantitative handover/takeover procedure by rail

In case of a delivery between a supplier within MOL Group and MOL Group’s tax warehouses and terminals with excise duty licence, the basis of the acceptance is the net quantity shown on the bill of lading for an undamaged shipment and loss in transport cannot be charged unless there are special restrictions in the local law.  
For a qualified supplier, in case the shipment is undamaged, the net quantity shown on the bill of lading must be entered into the inventory, unless otherwise is provided in the contract or local legislation.

The product quantity in the receiving tank must be measured before the reception (so called pre-gauging) and after the reception (so called post-gauging). The gauging procedure must be carried out during every reception. 

The quantity of the received product is the difference between the pre and post gauging results.
After the reception, it must be defined whether a shortage or surplus is found. In case shortage or surplus is found the responsible manager must initiate the proper corrective action, or claim as necessary.
A shortage/surplus report must be prepared in accordance with the local excise duty regulations.

Based on the gauging results a report on the product reception must be prepared and continuously kept in a “Tank Log”, or in any other document or IT application that satisfies the minimum contents requirements set in Appendix 15. 

If accounting is not made on tank data basis, but on the data from other measuring device, the pre and post gauging data of the goods receiving tank still must be taken into consideration.

During the reception procedure, the use of a running gauge system (receiving and loading at the same time in/from storage tank) should be avoided if possible (taking into considerations technical features).
c. Special requirements for quantitative handover/takeover procedure by rail

In case of a delivery between a supplier within MOL Group and MOL Group’s tax warehouses and terminals with excise duty licence, the basis of the acceptance is the net quantity shown on the bill of lading for an undamaged shipment and loss in transport cannot be charged unless there are special restrictions in the local law.  
For a qualified supplier, in case the shipment is undamaged, the net quantity shown on the bill of lading must be entered into the inventory, unless otherwise is provided in the contract or local legislation.

For any other supply, if upon weighting prior to unloading, a difference in excess of 0,2% - for gases the allowable maximum difference is 200kg – is found compared to the bill of lading, and in all cases when receiving Bio-ethanol and FAME, the basis for the reception is the quantity established by official weighting carried out on receiver’s site unless otherwise provided for in the contract or in the local legislation.

For rail tank cars (RTC) with broken or missing lead seals the arriving goods must be registered in the inventory on the basis of the  bridge scales slips prepared upon the weighting made wagon by wagon on receiver’s certified/verified bridge scales. The cause of possible differences must be investigated in a joint effort with the supplier and a report must be prepared on the investigation.

Controlling the quantity - Pipeline,storage tank,91.81818181818181,"a. General rules for quantitative acceptance of a product

Defining the quantity received may be made on the basis of the pre- and post-gauging data of the tank, or by other verified metering device (such as a flow meter).
If it is made on the basis of tank gauging data, the procedure to follow is:

The product quantity in the receiving tank must be measured before the reception (so called pre-gauging) and after the reception (so called post-gauging). The gauging procedure must be carried out during every reception. 

The quantity of the received product is the difference between the pre and post gauging results.
After the reception, it must be defined whether a shortage or surplus is found. In case shortage or surplus is found the responsible manager must initiate the proper corrective action, or claim as necessary.
A shortage/surplus report must be prepared in accordance with the local excise duty regulations.

Based on the gauging results a report on the product reception must be prepared and continuously kept in a “Tank Log”, or in any other document or IT application that satisfies the minimum contents requirements set in Appendix 15. 

If accounting is not made on tank data basis, but on the data from other measuring device, the pre and post gauging data of the goods receiving tank still must be taken into consideration.

During the reception procedure, the use of a running gauge system (receiving and loading at the same time in/from storage tank) should be avoided if possible (taking into considerations technical features).

•    the pre and post gauging data (tank level in mm, average temperature in oC, and density at 15oC as per Standard ISO 3675) of the receiving tank, taken with verified measuring device (tertiary gauging)
•    for reception in a running gauge system, in the absence of primary and secondary gauging, the tertiary gauging must be extended on the quantity loaded into the transport means. Record must be kept on transport means loaded in a running gauge system, with the minimum data contents as per Appendix 5.

Deviation from the primary gauging must be approved by the responsible manager in written form (IT application or equivalent is acceptable).

The product quantity accepted during a reception by pipeline must be documented in a report with the minimum data contents as per Appendix 3. The report must be signed off by the representative of both the transferor and the receiver.

In the case of storing gases in a liquid state the received stock must be defined on the basis of the verified metering device mounted on the tank. When defining the quantity received, if the process conditions are given, the quantity of the gaseous phase above the liquid level in the tank must also be defined and taken into consideration.

The product quantity in the receiving tank must be measured before the reception (so called pre-gauging) and after the reception (so called post-gauging). The gauging procedure must be carried out during every reception. 

The quantity of the received product is the difference between the pre and post gauging results.
After the reception, it must be defined whether a shortage or surplus is found. In case shortage or surplus is found the responsible manager must initiate the proper corrective action, or claim as necessary.
A shortage/surplus report must be prepared in accordance with the local excise duty regulations.

Based on the gauging results a report on the product reception must be prepared and continuously kept in a “Tank Log”, or in any other document or IT application that satisfies the minimum contents requirements set in Appendix 15. 

If accounting is not made on tank data basis, but on the data from other measuring device, the pre and post gauging data of the goods receiving tank still must be taken into consideration.

During the reception procedure, the use of a running gauge system (receiving and loading at the same time in/from storage tank) should be avoided if possible (taking into considerations technical features).
b. Special requirements for handover/takeover procedure by pipeline

Defining the quantity of the product received must be made by means of:

•    primarily the flow read by the verified flow metering instrument at the reception point (primary gauging), or in its absence  
•    the flow read by the verified flow metering instrument at the sending point (secondary gauging), or in its absence 
•    the pre and post gauging data (tank level in mm, average temperature in oC, and density at 15oC as per Standard ISO 3675) of the receiving tank, taken with verified measuring device (tertiary gauging)
•    for reception in a running gauge system, in the absence of primary and secondary gauging, the tertiary gauging must be extended on the quantity loaded into the transport means. Record must be kept on transport means loaded in a running gauge system, with the minimum data contents as per Appendix 5.

Deviation from the primary gauging must be approved by the responsible manager in written form (IT application or equivalent is acceptable).

The product quantity accepted during a reception by pipeline must be documented in a report with the minimum data contents as per Appendix 3. The report must be signed off by the representative of both the transferor and the receiver.

In the case of storing gases in a liquid state the received stock must be defined on the basis of the verified metering device mounted on the tank. When defining the quantity received, if the process conditions are given, the quantity of the gaseous phase above the liquid level in the tank must also be defined and taken into consideration. The complete stock must be established from the total quantity of the product in liquid and gaseous state. Where an accurate measuring of the gaseous phase is not feasible a liquid level gauge of e.g. radar type must be used for establishing the product quantity.
