On MOL Group level preferable CMMS is standard SAP solution. Equipment database in CMMS has to be fulfilled and updated by dedicated responsible person. Processes in CMMS have to be simplified enough, but still in line with MOL Group LDA, with minimal number of paperwork.

Each Notification should contain technical scope of work, the latest admissible completion date, the earliest start date, the materials provided by the requestor and the work completion priority. All ordered works shall be assigned to a dedicated funding source.
The notifications can be issued by local Maintenance staff, Operation staff or generated automatically by System. 
Special group of works is the Autonomous maintenance activities. These works are issued in CMMS, executed by Business unit Maintenance staff or Operation staff but without mandatory prioritization on RBWS.

2.3.6 Maintenance execution process,Work order selection (RBWS),Maintenance management,"For each maintenance work item, prioritizing shall be done through risk assessment or Risk Based Work Selection (hereinafter: RBWS) prior to ordering which then gets recorded in the CMMS. The potential hazards are evaluated according to valid risk Matrix. The necessity of performing or rejecting a given work item, and the latest admissible completion date shall be determined on the basis of the assessed risks. As the part of overall operation responsibility, the final decision about priority is made by Operation.
The maintenance works are categorized as follows:
•    technically plannable and schedulable works, that are called “Normal”
•    schedule breaker works, that can be “Urgent” works or “Emergency” (havaria) works
•    small works.

Normal works
     
Work to be technically planned by Maintenance staff and/or SSC where relevant and scheduled in advance by SSC/Maintenance supplier through a normal process. SSC/Maintenance supplier plans shall be prepared in 14 calendar days and gives proposal for the scheduling. Requestor shall approve it in 7 calendar days. Earliest start date shall be minimum the 22nd day from the date of ordering. Start before 22nd day is possible only based on previous agreement between supplier and Operation - free capacities are available on supplier site and asset is available for maintenance. In case of work orders with Normal priority SSC is required to prepare and submit offer for approval.

Urgent and emergency (havaria) works

Work order is considered to be urgent if the requested starting date of execution is between the 4th and the 21st day from the requesting date. Maintenance supplier shall prepare detailed plan depending on available resources, but it is not mandatory. 

Emergency works are not plannable, ex-post administrated works where work starts immediately and lasts until the problem is solved. An attempt shall be made to register the work order within a working day after the work started.

These works can be accounted based on factual due to time limitation for detailed technical preparation, but in case of possibility - similarly to normal works - the technical preparation and the usage of “preliminary technical and prize offer” accounting solution has to be used. In case of urgent works the administration shall be before work execution.

Accounting for transport losses:

For loaded quantities within MOL Group (supplying own terminals) no transport difference may be accounted for. (Except the transport means arrived with damaged or incomplete security seals. In that case the realized loss must be claimed from the transporter)

In other cases transport loss may be accounted for transportation with suspended excise tax or approved customer claims only, case by case on the basis of difference between the quantity of the dispatched and received goods. For an EU delivery a counter signature by the authorities is required and the duty will be levied through a resolution by the member state authority.

The shortage generated in transit is the liability of the dispatching tax warehouse, except if an agreement has been made with the transporter on the joint and several liabilities. 

For release to free circulation the losses must be accounted for document by document (SAAD - Simplified Accompanying Administration Document). The quantity leaving the tax warehouse must be shown compulsorily on the SAAD. The accounting for loss in transit must be regulated in a contract. 

The product transfer pipeline functions as a special tax warehouse, the loss that can be accounted during delivery by product transport pipeline, is set forth by the customs and finance guard agency exercising the current authority supervision of the tax warehouse, with consideration given to the characteristics relating to the product transfer pipeline.

For the acceptable loss for non-excise duty licensed trading (retail) of the excise duty mineral oil products the country-specific loss regulation is applicable.

The rates of acceptable loss norms during deliveries are covered in Appendix 4.

Unless otherwise is regulated in the commercial contract, the quality of the loaded product must be qualified from the average combined sample generated from the samples taken from the loading arm at the beginning, half way through and after the completion of loading procedure. A verifying certificate must be prepared on the qualifications, which is then to be attached to the goods accompanying documents.
In case when the barge/vessel was cleaned directly before loading (1st loading after cleaning), samples should be taken from the compartment of the barge/vessel after completing the loading procedure in order to check the quality.

The samples taken for verifying the conformity of the product being discharged must be kept safe as control samples for one month, with the requirements of Group Guideline QC_1 “Quality Control” adhered to. In case of gaseous products and pentanes, control samples must not be stored for archiving.

Accounting for transport losses:

For loaded quantities within MOL Group (supplying own terminals) no transport difference may be accounted for. (Except the transport means arrived with damaged or incomplete security seals. In that case the realized loss must be claimed from the transporter)

In other cases transport loss may be accounted for transportation with suspended excise tax or approved customer claims only, case by case on the basis of difference between the quantity of the dispatched and received goods. For an EU delivery a counter signature by the authorities is required and the duty will be levied through a resolution by the member state authority.

The shortage generated in transit is the liability of the dispatching tax warehouse, except if an agreement has been made with the transporter on the joint and several liabilities. 

For release to free circulation the losses must be accounted for document by document (SAAD - Simplified Accompanying Administration Document). The quantity leaving the tax warehouse must be shown compulsorily on the SAAD. The accounting for loss in transit must be regulated in a contract. 

The product transfer pipeline functions as a special tax warehouse, the loss that can be accounted during delivery by product transport pipeline, is set forth by the customs and finance guard agency exercising the current authority supervision of the tax warehouse, with consideration given to the characteristics relating to the product transfer pipeline.

For the acceptable loss for non-excise duty licensed trading (retail) of the excise duty mineral oil products the country-specific loss regulation is applicable.

The rates of acceptable loss norms during deliveries are covered in Appendix 4. When defining the acceptable loss norms the norms set forth in the applicable regulations of the given country, are applicable. In case the norms of the applicable national regulation are more permissive than those defined in appendix 4, the values in the present table must be used.


All shortages above the norm, generated in the transportation process, must be investigated and reported to the head of Product Storage Management and to the head of the relevant Transportation Unit (Road, Rail/Barge).

The product quantity in the receiving tank must be measured before the reception (so called pre-gauging) and after the reception (so called post-gauging). The gauging procedure must be carried out during every reception. 

The quantity of the received product is the difference between the pre and post gauging results.
After the reception, it must be defined whether a shortage or surplus is found. In case shortage or surplus is found the responsible manager must initiate the proper corrective action, or claim as necessary.
A shortage/surplus report must be prepared in accordance with the local excise duty regulations.

Based on the gauging results a report on the product reception must be prepared and continuously kept in a “Tank Log”, or in any other document or IT application that satisfies the minimum contents requirements set in Appendix 15. 

If accounting is not made on tank data basis, but on the data from other measuring device, the pre and post gauging data of the goods receiving tank still must be taken into consideration.

For a qualified supplier, in case the shipment is undamaged, the net quantity shown on the bill of lading must be entered into the inventory, unless otherwise is provided in the contract or local legislation.

For any other supply, if upon weighting prior to unloading, a difference in excess of 0,2% - for gases the allowable maximum difference is 200kg – is found compared to the bill of lading, and in all cases when receiving Bio-ethanol and FAME, the basis for the reception is the quantity established by official weighting carried out on receiver’s site unless otherwise provided for in the contract or in the local legislation.

For rail tank cars (RTC) with broken or missing lead seals the arriving goods must be registered in the inventory on the basis of the  bridge scales slips prepared upon the weighting made wagon by wagon on receiver’s certified/verified bridge scales. The cause of possible differences must be investigated in a joint effort with the supplier and a report must be prepared on the investigation.

10. Receiving / product acceptance,Controlling the quantity - Pipeline,Dispatcher / shift supervisor,"a. General rules for quantitative acceptance of a product

Defining the quantity received may be made on the basis of the pre- and post-gauging data of the tank, or by other verified metering device (such as a flow meter).
If it is made on the basis of tank gauging data, the procedure to follow is:

The product quantity in the receiving tank must be measured before the reception (so called pre-gauging) and after the reception (so called post-gauging). The gauging procedure must be carried out during every reception. 

The quantity of the received product is the difference between the pre and post gauging results.
After the reception, it must be defined whether a shortage or surplus is found. In case shortage or surplus is found the responsible manager must initiate the proper corrective action, or claim as necessary.
A shortage/surplus report must be prepared in accordance with the local excise duty regulations.

Based on the gauging results a report on the product reception must be prepared and continuously kept in a “Tank Log”, or in any other document or IT application that satisfies the minimum contents requirements set in Appendix 15. 

If accounting is not made on tank data basis, but on the data from other measuring device, the pre and post gauging data of the goods receiving tank still must be taken into consideration.

During the reception procedure, the use of a running gauge system (receiving and loading at the same time in/from storage tank) should be avoided if possible (taking into considerations technical features).
b. Special requirements for handover/takeover procedure by pipeline

Defining the quantity of the product received must be made by means of:

•    primarily the flow read by the verified flow metering instrument at the reception point (primary gauging), or in its absence  
•    the flow read by the verified flow metering instrument at the sending point (secondary gauging), or in its absence 
•    the pre and post gauging data (tank level in mm, average temperature in oC, and density at 15oC as per Standard ISO 3675) of the receiving tank, taken with verified measuring device (tertiary gauging)
•    for reception in a running gauge system, in the absence of primary and secondary gauging, the tertiary gauging must be extended on the quantity loaded into the transport means. Record must be kept on transport means loaded in a running gauge system, with the minimum data contents as per Appendix 5.

Deviation from the primary gauging must be approved by the responsible manager in written form (IT application or equivalent is acceptable).

The product quantity accepted during a reception by pipeline must be documented in a report with the minimum data contents as per Appendix 3. The report must be signed off by the representative of both the transferor and the receiver.

In the case of storing gases in a liquid state the received stock must be defined on the basis of the verified metering device mounted on the tank. When defining the quantity received, if the process conditions are given, the quantity of the gaseous phase above the liquid level in the tank must also be defined and taken into consideration. The complete stock must be established from the total quantity of the product in liquid and gaseous state. Where an accurate measuring of the gaseous phase is not feasible a liquid level gauge of e.g. radar type must be used for establishing the product quantity.
